# AWS Observability Accelerator

The AWS Observability Accelerator is a set of opinionated modules to help you set up observability for your AWS environments with AWS Native services and AWS-managed observability services such as Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus,Amazon Managed Grafana, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) and Amazon CloudWatch.

We provide curated metrics, logs, traces collection, cloudwatch dashboard, alerting rules and Grafana dashboards for your EKS infrastructure, Java/JMX, NGINX based workloads and your custom applications.

AWS Observability Accelerator provide shared artifacts (documentation, dashboards, alerting rules) for the [Terraform](https://github.com/aws-observability/terraform-aws-observability-accelerator) and [CDK](https://github.com/aws-observability/cdk-aws-observability-accelerator) projects.
